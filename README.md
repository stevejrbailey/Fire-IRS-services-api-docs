### The Home Office Incident Recording System (IRS) Web Services API Documentation

The system has a number of web service apis that are based on SOAP/XML interfaces. The project contains all the documents required by developers to design, develop and test interfaces to interact with the IRS system. Start by reading the **IRS Information Modelling Pack v1-0i - ReadMe.pdf** document that defines the structure and contents of the repository.
